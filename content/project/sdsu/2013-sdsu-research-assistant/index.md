I am building a vacuum sputtering system within a ISO 3 clean-room. I am
working independently without supervision; I keep Dr. Fan informed of my
progress. I have ordered and assembled a pneumatic circuit to allow gas to flow
into the chamber. I have connected a circuit to use feedback from a
thermocouple to control the voltage supplied to a heater.

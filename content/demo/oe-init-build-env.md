Let's have a clean environment, and then clone Poky.

```
└─> bash -norc
bash-4.3$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky /tmp/poky

Let's compare our env before and after the script.

```
bash-4.3$ env > /tmp/0 
bash-4.3$ source /tmp/poky/oe-init-build-env /tmp/build/
You had no conf/local.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been
created for you with some default values. You may wish to edit it to, for
example, select a different MACHINE (target hardware). See conf/local.conf
for more information as common configuration options are commented.

You had no conf/bblayers.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been
created for you with some default values. To add additional metadata layers
into your configuration please add entries to conf/bblayers.conf.

The Yocto Project has extensive documentation about OE including a reference
manual which can be found at:

### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
bash-4.3$ env > /tmp/1
```

What is new in our 'env'?

## Introduction

Nathan will talk about Datalad and Git Annex to members of [PenguinsUnbound][].

### Goal

TODO

### From the Author

Introduction to git-annex by the author, [Joey Hess][], from the [website][].

> git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when dealing
with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due to
limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
>
> git-annex is designed for git users who love the command line. For everyone
else, the git-annex assistant turns git-annex into an easy to use folder
synchroniser.

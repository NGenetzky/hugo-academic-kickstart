At the beginning of fall semester I heard about a contest SDSU was putting on
for android app development. I was the first student to the meeting and I was
surrounded with companies that wanted apps developed; as I talked to companies
about what they wanted I would offer suggestions of how I could achieve their
goals. I am now working on developing an app for Rainbow Play Systems, a nation
wide company that is centered in the Midwest. I formed a team of approximately
5 students and I created and delegated tasks. On the other hand I met with the
company and tried to formalize the design constraints.

Rainbow Play allows you or your kids to design a unique playground. The menus
include graphics so that it is easy to see what you are adding to your own
personal playground. The app allows you to send a detailed report via email to
Rainbow Play Systems so that you can receive information to help you with your
purchase.  The [website](http://www.rainbowplay.com/) provides additional
information and resources for Rainbow Play Systems.

## Building

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) automatically builds when a new commit is
pushed and hosts the website for free.

### Docker-Compose

Simply run 'docker-compose' in the root of the directory. The Hugo container
will host the website and watch for changes. This is great for development.

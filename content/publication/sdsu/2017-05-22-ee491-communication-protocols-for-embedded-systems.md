abstract = "Electrical Engineers use various electronic devices to measure signals and control systems. These individual devices can accomplish many things, but with a communication system in place they can work together to accomplish even greater tasks.  A microcontroller can communicate with various devices to expand its functionality. An embedded system can be interfaced with a device with greater processing power to allow more complex algorithms to be run or to coordinate with systems at other locations. Alternatively, a microcontroller could also utilize a sensor at a remote location. This paper will examine the theory and procedure to implement a few of these communication protocols."
